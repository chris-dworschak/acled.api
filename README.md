# Automated Retrieval of ACLED Conflict Event Data

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.com/chris-dworschak/acled.api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/chris-dworschak/acled.api)
<!-- badges: end -->

This small package makes it easy to automatically retrieve a
user-defined sample or all available data of ACLED: the package provides
functionality to access and manage the application programming interface
(API) of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) at
<https://acleddata.com/>.

When using this package, you acknowledge that you have read ACLEDâ€™s
terms and conditions of use, and that you agree with their attribution
requirements.

## Installation

You can install the released version of acled.api from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("acled.api")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-dworschak/acled.api") # downloads and installs the package
```

## Example

Using acled.api is straight forward. To download data on, for example,
all ACLED conflict events in Europe and Central America that happened
between June 2019 and July 2020, you can supply:

``` r
library(acled.api) # loads the package
#> 
#> By using this package, you acknowledge that you have read ACLED's terms
#> and conditions. The data must be cited as per ACLED attribution requirements.
#> The package may be cited as:
