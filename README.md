This small package provides functionality to access and manage the
application programming interface (API) of the [Armed Conflict Location
& Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/). The package
`acleda.api` makes it easy to retrieve a user-defined sample (or all of
the available data) of ACLED, enabling a seamless integration of regular
data updates into the research work flow.

Important: When using this package, you acknowledge that you have read
ACLEDâ€™s terms and conditions of use, and that you agree with their
attribution requirements.

## Installation

You can install the released version of acled.api from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("acled.api")
```

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-dworschak/acled.api") # downloads and installs the package
```

## Example

Using `acled.api` is straight forward. To download data on, for example,
all ACLED conflict events in Europe and Central America that happened
between June 2019 and July 2020, you can supply:

``` r
library(acled.api) # loads the package
#> 
#> By using this package, you acknowledge that you have read ACLED's terms
#> and conditions. The data must be cited as per ACLED attribution requirements.
#> The package may be cited as:
#> Dworschak, Christoph. 2020. "Acled.api: Automated Retrieval of ACLED Conflict
#> Event Data." R package version 1.0.2. <https://github.com/chris-dworschak/acled.api/>

my.data.frame <- acled.api( # stores an ACLED sample in object my.data.frame
  regions = c("Europe", "Central America"), 
  start.date = "2019-06-01", 
  end.date = "2020-07-31")
#> Your ACLED data request was successful. Events were retrieved for the period starting 2019-06-01 until 2020-07-31.
